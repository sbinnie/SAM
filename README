SAM - a minor Sports Association Management component for Joomla! 2.5+.

The component is to manage the registration and allocation of players, teams, divisions, sponsors and coaching staff. The 
component also maintains the executive contact list and provides front end addition of team nes by coaches. The team
news can then be allocated to team-specific email correspondence.
